## üìù Abstract
Accurate brain parcellation in diffusion MRI (dMRI) space is essential for advanced neuroimaging analyses. However, most existing approaches rely on anatomical MRI for segmentation and inter-modality registration, a process that can introduce errors and limit the versatility of the technique. In this study, we present a novel deep learning-based framework for direct parcellation based on the Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlas using only diffusion MRI data. Our method utilizes a hierarchical, two-stage segmentation network: the first stage performs coarse parcellation into broad brain regions, and the second stage refines the segmentation to delineate more detailed subregions within each coarse category. We conduct an extensive ablation study to evaluate various diffusion-derived parameter maps, identifying an optimal combination of fractional anisotropy, trace, sphericity, and maximum eigenvalue that enhances parcellation accuracy. When evaluated on the Human Connectome Project and Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics datasets, our approach achieves superior Dice Similarity Coefficients compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our method demonstrates robust generalization across different image resolutions and acquisition protocols, producing more homogeneous parcellations as measured by the relative standard deviation within regions. This work represents a significant advancement in dMRI-based brain segmentation, providing a precise, reliable, and registration-free solution that is critical for improved structural connectivity and microstructural analyses in both research and clinical applications.

## :gear: Hierarchical Framework

Our method introduces a two-stage hierarchical 3D deep learning framework for direct Desikan‚ÄìKilliany brain parcellation using diffusion MRI data. The architecture follows a coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy, where the first stage performs broad anatomical division and the second stage refines these regions into detailed cortical and subcortical parcels. This design enables accurate and efficient parcellation without relying on anatomical MRI or inter-modality registration.

## üìà Results
Our hierarchical 3D deep learning framework achieved state-of-the-art performance in direct Desikan‚ÄìKilliany brain parcellation from diffusion MRI data.
Compared to existing methods, it consistently delivered higher Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) and lower Hausdorff Distances (HD95), while maintaining excellent generalization across multiple datasets and acquisition protocols.
Through an extensive parameter impact study, we also found that combining **Fractional Anisotropy (FA)**, **Trace**, **Sphericity**, and the **Maximum Eigenvalue** yields the most accurate and stable parcellation performance, highlighting the importance of complementary diffusion-derived features.
